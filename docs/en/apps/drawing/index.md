# Drawing

Drawing is a basic image editor that can resize, crop or rotate an image, apply simple filters, insert or censor text, and manipulate a selected part of an image: cut, copy, paste, drag, etc.

It is also possible to draw using tools such as: pencil, straight line, curve tool, many shapes, several brushes, as well as their different colors and options.
