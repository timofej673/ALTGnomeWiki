# Gaphor

Gaphor is a modeling application for UML, SysML, RAAML and C4. It is designed to be easy to use while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a fully compliant UML 2 data model, so it's much more than a picture-drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system, as well as to create complete, highly complex models.

Gaphor provides four modeling languages: UML, SysML, RAAML and C4 and makes them accessible to beginners.
