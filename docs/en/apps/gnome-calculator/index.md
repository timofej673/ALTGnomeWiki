# Calculator

A calculator is an application that solves mathematical equations. Although at first glance it's a simple calculator with basic arithmetic, you can switch to Advanced Mode, Financial Mode, or Programming Mode to discover an amazing array of capabilities.

Advanced mode supports many operations, including: logarithms, factorials, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, modulo division, complex numbers, random number generator, prime factorization, and unit conversion.

Financial mode supports several calculations, including periodic interest rate, present and future value, doubling and straight-line depreciation, and many others.

The programming mode supports conversions between common number systems (binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal), Boolean algebra, reciprocal and complement codes, character code conversion and other features.
