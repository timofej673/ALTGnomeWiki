# Déjà Dup Backups

Déjà Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of doing backups correctly (using encryption, storing away from your computer, copying regularly) and uses duplicity as a back-end interface.

- Supports local, remote or cloud backup locations such as Google Drive
- Securely encrypts and compresses data
- Staged backup, allows you to restore from specific backups
- Schedule regular backups
- Integrates well with the GNOME desktop

Déjà Dup focuses on the ease of use of recovering personal data in the event of loss. If you require a full system backup or archiving program, consider other backup program options.
