# Hardware Probe (hw-probe)

Hardware Probe (hw-probe) is a tool for testing the functionality of computer hardware and uploading the results to a Linux hardware database. Designed to make it easier to collect the history needed
to investigate hardware problems

Probe is a snapshot of your computer's hardware status and logs. The tool checks the health of devices by analyzing logs and returns a persistent URL in the public database [Linux Hardware](https://linux-hardware.org/) to view the computer scan.
