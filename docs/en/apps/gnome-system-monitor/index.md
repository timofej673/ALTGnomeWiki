# System monitor

System Monitor is a simple tool for viewing and managing processes.

System Monitor can help you determine which applications are using your computer's processor or memory, can manage running applications, stop frozen processes, and change the state or priority of running processes.

The resource graph display feature provides a quick overview of what's going on with your computer, showing network, memory, and processor usage.
