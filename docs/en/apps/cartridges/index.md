# Cartridges

Cartridges is a simple application for launching your games. It supports importing games from [Steam](/en/apps/steam/), [Lutris](/en/apps/lutris/), [Heroic](/en/apps/heroic-games-launcher/) and other gaming platforms without the need to log in. You can sort and hide games or download artwork from SteamGridDB.
