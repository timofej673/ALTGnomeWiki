# Fastfetch

Fastfetch is a tool for displaying system information and displaying it in an attractive way, similar to [Neofetch](/en/apps/neofetch/). It is written primarily in C with performance and customizability in mind. Linux, Android, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows 7 (or later) are currently supported.
