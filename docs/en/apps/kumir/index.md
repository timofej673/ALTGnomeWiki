# KuMir

KuMir (Комплект Учебных МИРов - Set of Educational Worlds) is a programming system designed for initial courses in computer science and programming in secondary and high schools.

The KuMir system uses a school algorithmic language with Russian vocabulary and built-in executors Robot and Draftsman. When entering a program, KuMir carries out constant full control of its correctness, reporting in the fields of the program about all detected errors. When executing a program in step-by-step mode, KuMir displays the results of assignment operations and the values ​​of logical expressions in the fields. This allows you to speed up the process of mastering the basics of programming. KuMir runs on Windows and Linux operating systems.
