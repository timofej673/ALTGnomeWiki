# GPU Screen Recorder

GPU Screen Recorder is a screen recording program. When recording, it has minimal impact on system performance since it records the monitor only using the GPU, similar to ShadowPlay in Windows. This is the fastest screen recording tool on Linux. The screen recorder works in both X11 and Wayland windowing interfaces.
