# Lunacy

Lunacy is a next generation vector graphics software for UX/UI and web design. It has everything you are used to in other similar applications, and even more. Created by designers for designers to help you stay focused on your workflow and minimize distractions. No more wasting time searching for graphics online, switching apps to remove backgrounds, or thinking about placeholder texts. Faster than [Figma](/ru/apps/figma/); Smarter than Sketch.
