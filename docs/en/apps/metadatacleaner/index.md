# Metadata cleaner

Metadata in a file can tell you a lot about you. Cameras record data about when and where a photo was taken and what camera was used. Office applications automatically add author and company information to documents and spreadsheets. This is confidential information and you may not want to disclose it.

This tool allows you to view metadata in files and get rid of it if possible.
