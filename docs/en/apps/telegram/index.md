# Telegram

Telegram is a cross-platform instant messaging system (messenger) with functions for exchanging text, voice and video messages, as well as stickers, photos and files of many formats.

## Disable notification to the active window (Draw attention to the window)

The messenger informs the user about the active chat by sending a notification. You can disable the option by going to:

- Settings
- Notifications and sounds
- Disable the Draw attention to the window option

## Problem displaying notifications in Telegram

If, instead of a notification with the text of the incoming message, you see something like this:

1. Then go to: _Settings -> Advanced settings -> Experimental settings_ enable the **GNotification** option
2. Reboot the Telegram client and check the result.

## Use system frame in Telegram

Enable the system frame as follows:

- Open Telegram Desktop
- Settings -> Advanced settings
- Uncheck "QT Window Frame"

<AGWGallery />

The design of the system frame depends on the application window interface `X11` or `Wayland`.

## Replacing characters in messages

When writing messages in Telegram, the text is automatically formatted. This is done to make the text easier to read and to follow typographic rules:

| Symbol      | Modifier                 |
| :---------- | :----------------------- |
| `--`        | Em dash (—)              |
| `<<` и `>>` | French quotes («ёлочки») |

## Ignore disabled chats and channels in the notification counter

Set up notification counter:

- Go to Settings -> Notifications and sounds
- Disable the “Count silent chats” setting

## WebApp does not work in Telegram from a repository in a Wayland session

If you encounter the error `Error: Could not initalize WebView`, there are several ways to fix it:

- Change the launch parameters of the Telegram application: launch the application in the X11 window interface.
- Select a different installation type for the Telegram messenger.
