# Gear Lever

Do you use AppImage format programs? But you donâ€™t remember where you saved them and where they are now? You don't know how to update them? Are you uncomfortable launching them and don't know how to add them to the launcher or dock?

So, you need to pay attention to Gear Lever. This is the AppImage application manager (https://appimage.org/, https://appimage.github.io/).

Some features of Gear Lever:

- Integrate AppImage applications into the launch menu with one click, or launch them directly from the Gear Lever manager;
- Supports organizing your AppImage applications in one selected directory;
- Manages updates to your AppImage programs, and you can mark those that do not need to be updated;
- Automatically saves by executable file name those of your AppImage applications that have a command interface;
- Gear Lever provides a friendly and intuitive control interface;
- Controlled using Drag and Drop. Simply drag and drop your AppImages into the program window.
