# About

We present to your attention the documentation for the **ALT Regular Gnome** components, open to everyone.

This is an Open Source project hosted on GitHub. This placement allows everyone to add to the “Documentation” pages, make forks, clone the project, saving and changing to their liking.

## Operating principle

**ALT Gnome Wiki** is powered by VitePress technology. These are static text files, with the md extension, with some “decorating” additions from VitePress. Unlike the “dry” md markup language, we get the opportunity to place emoticons, highlight and focus on important code elements, add beautiful colored Warning blocks and much more tasty and bright things.

The documentation portal is linked to our GitHub repository. Submit your edits as a Pull Request and once approved, they will instantly appear on the site.

## Authors and participants of the project

The **ALT Gnome Wiki** project belongs to the Russian-speaking **ALT Gnome** community, and is developed and maintained on a voluntary basis. Each of the community members is an equal co-owner of the project and makes his/her own contribution.
